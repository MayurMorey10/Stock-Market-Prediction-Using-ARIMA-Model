#**stock market predictions using Arima model**
For the project, I did know some python coding and also learned the Python Programming Language from the resources shared along with the Udemy course my friend has. Link:-https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17837488?start=30#overview

While I became comfortable with Python, I started learning about various Python Libraries like Pandas, and Numpy through the resources shared and other libraries like Matplotlib, seaborm and a bit of scikitlearn through the udemy course which my friend has Link:- https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/17833570?start=1#overview

Now after this I learned about the application of these libraries in EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) of the data using pandas and matplotlib and seaborn. How we can get initial and useful insights the moment we get the data and how to deal with missing stuff in the raw data. Now I wish to start coding and do hands on , once further resources and instructions are shared.
